# Up For Adoption

This repository is up for adoption. I am looking for a maintainer I can transfer the project to. Please see #25 for more information.

# Alpine Package Builder

This is a Docker image for building Alpine Linux packages.

[![Docker](https://github.com/sgerrand/docker-alpine-abuild/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/sgerrand/docker-alpine-abuild/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml)

## Usage

We tag each release with the Alpine Linux version used. Here are the tags to choose from:

* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.7`: based on Alpine 3.7
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.8`: based on Alpine 3.8
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.9`: based on Alpine 3.9
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.10`: based on Alpine 3.10
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.11`: based on Alpine 3.11

* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.13`: based on Alpine 3.13
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.14`: based on Alpine 3.14
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.15`: based on Alpine 3.15
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.16`: based on Alpine 3.16
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.17`: based on Alpine 3.17
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.18`: based on Alpine 3.18
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.19`: based on Alpine 3.19
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:3.20`: based on [Alpine 3.20](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.20.0-released.html)
* `strophy/alpine-abuild:3.21`: based on [Alpine 3.21](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.21.0-released.html)
* `sgerrand/alpine-abuild:edge`: based on Alpine edge (includes testing repository as well)

The builder is typically run from your Alpine Linux package source directory (changing `~/.abuild/mykey.rsa` and `~/.abuild/mykey.rsa.pub` to your packager private and public key locations):

```
docker run \
	-e RSA_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ~/.abuild/mykey.rsa)" \
	-e RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_NAME="mykey.rsa" \
	-v "$PWD:/home/builder/package" \
	-v "$HOME/.abuild/packages:/packages" \
	-v "$HOME/.abuild/mykey.rsa.pub:/etc/apk/keys/mykey.rsa.pub" \
	-it --rm --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 \
	strophy/alpine-abuild:3.21
```

This would build the package at your current working directory, and place the resulting packages in `~/.abuild/packages/builder/x86_64`. Subsequent builds of packages will update the `~/.abuild/packages/builder/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz` file.

You can also run the builder anywhere. You just need to mount your package source and build directories to `/home/builder/package` and `/packages`, respectively.

## Environment

There are a number of environment variables you can change at package build time:

* `RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`: This is the contents of your RSA private key. This is optional. You should use `PACKAGER_PRIVKEY` and mount your private key if not using `RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`.
* `RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_NAME`: Defaults to `ssh.rsa`. This is the name we will set the private key file as when using `RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`. The file will be written out to `/home/builder/$RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_NAME`.
* `PACKAGER_PRIVKEY`: Defaults to `/home/builder/.abuild/$RSA_PRIVATE_KEY_NAME`. This is generally used if you are bind mounting your private key instead of passing it in with `RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`.
* `REPODEST`: Defaults to `/packages`. If you want to override the destination of the build packages. You must also be sure the `builder` user has access to write to the destination. The `abuilder` entry point will attempt to `mkdir -p` this location.
* `PACKAGER`: This is the name of the package used in package metadata.

## Keys

You can use this image to generate keys if you don't already have them. Generate them in a container using the following command (replacing `YOUR NAME <YOUR@EMAIL>` with your own name and email):

```
docker run --name keys --entrypoint abuild-keygen --env PACKAGER="YOUR NAME <YOUR@EMAIL>" strophy/alpine-abuild:3.21 -n
```

You'll see some output like the following:

```
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
.............................................+++
.................................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
writing RSA key
>>>
>>> You'll need to install /home/builder/.abuild/team@gliderlabs.com-5592f9b1.rsa.pub into
>>> /etc/apk/keys to be able to install packages and repositories signed with
>>> /home/builder/.abuild/team@gliderlabs.com-5592f9b1.rsa
>>>
>>> You might want add following line to /home/builder/.abuild/abuild.conf:
>>>
>>> PACKAGER_PRIVKEY="/home/builder/.abuild/team@gliderlabs.com-5592f9b1.rsa"
>>>
>>>
>>> Please remember to make a safe backup of your private key:
>>> /home/builder/.abuild/team@gliderlabs.com-5592f9b1.rsa
>>>
```

This output contains the path to your public and private keys. Copy the keys out of the container:

```a
mkdir ~/.abuild
docker cp keys:/home/builder/.abuild/team@gliderlabs.com-5592f9b1.rsa ~/.abuild/
docker cp keys:/home/builder/.abuild/team@gliderlabs.com-5592f9b1.rsa.pub ~/.abuild/
```

Put your key files in a same place and destroy this container:

```
docker rm -f keys
```

## APK Cache

The builder has configured APK to use `/var/cache/apk` as its cache directory. This directory can be mounted as a volume to prevent the repeated download of dependencies when building packages.
